Here's our current status in the refactoring plan:

**Phase 1: Configuration Management - COMPLETED**
- âœ… Moved all configuration code to ConfigurationManager
- âœ… Handles profiler, logger, callbacks, accelerator setup
- âœ… File: `training_config_manager.py`

**Phase 2: Data Management - COMPLETED**
- âœ… Created DataManager class 
- âœ… Moved all data loading and processing functions
- âœ… Implemented data loaders creation
- âœ… File: `data_manager.py`
- âœ… Updated train.py to use DataManager

**Phase 3: Training Infrastructure - NEXT STEP**
- ðŸ”² Need to create TrainingManager class
- ðŸ”² Move model initialization & checkpoint loading
- ðŸ”² Move training setup and execution
- ðŸ”² Move testing and evaluation logic
- ðŸ”² Move model and results saving
- ðŸ”² File to create: `training_manager.py`

**Phase 4: Results Management - NOT STARTED**
- ðŸ”² Move results collection and saving logic
- ðŸ”² Create ResultsManager class
- ðŸ”² File to create: `results_manager.py`

Current file status:
- train.py: Still contains training and results logic to be moved
- training_config_manager.py: Complete
- data_manager.py: Complete

Next action when resuming:
1. Create `training_manager.py`
2. Begin moving training-related code from train.py to TrainingManager class
3. Focus on model initialization and checkpoint loading first

The end goal is to have train.py be primarily orchestration code that uses these manager classes to handle specific concerns.

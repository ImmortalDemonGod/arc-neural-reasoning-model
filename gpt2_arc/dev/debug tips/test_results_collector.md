When debugging errors in the `test_results_collector.py` test suite, the most relevant files to examine are those directly involved in the functionality being tested. Here's a prioritized list of files that are most likely to provide information to help fix any issues:

1. **`gpt2_arc/src/utils/results_collector.py`**
   - **Reason:** This is the primary module being tested. Any errors in initialization, metric updates, or result handling are likely originating from here.
   - **Key Components to Check:**
     - `ResultsCollector` class implementation.
     - Methods like `update_train_metrics`, `update_val_metrics`, `set_test_results`, `add_task_specific_result`, and `get_summary`.
     - Initialization logic, especially how `experiment_id`, `timestamp`, and `config` are set up.

2. **`gpt2_arc/src/config.py`**
   - **Reason:** The test initializes `ResultsCollector` using configurations defined in this file. Errors related to configuration attributes (e.g., `n_embd`, `n_head`, `n_layer`, `batch_size`, etc.) may stem from issues in the configuration classes.
   - **Key Components to Check:**
     - `Config`, `ModelConfig`, and `TrainingConfig` dataclasses.
     - Any methods or default values that manipulate or validate configuration parameters.

3. **`gpt2_arc/src/utils/experiment_tracker.py`**
   - **Reason:** `ResultsCollector` may internally utilize `ExperimentTracker` for logging and tracking experiments. Issues in experiment tracking could affect the results collection process.
   - **Key Components to Check:**
     - `ExperimentTracker` class methods, especially those related to logging metrics and handling experiment IDs.
     - Initialization and any interactions with external services like WandB (if `use_wandb` is enabled).

4. **Dependencies and External Modules:**
   - **`gpt2_arc/src/utils/results_collector.py` Dependencies:**
     - Ensure that any utility functions or classes used within `ResultsCollector` are functioning correctly.
   - **Environment and Configuration Files:**
     - Check for any environment-specific configurations or dependencies that might affect the test execution.

5. **Test Environment Setup:**
   - Although the test file itself is primarily for testing, ensure that the `setUp` method correctly initializes all necessary components. Misconfigurations or incorrect setups here can lead to misleading test failures.

**Steps to Diagnose the Issue:**

1. **Identify the Error Message:**
   - Start by examining the exact error message or traceback from the failed test. This will often point directly to the problematic line of code.

2. **Trace the Source:**
   - Use the traceback to trace back to the source file and line number where the error originated. This will help you determine whether the issue is within `results_collector.py`, `config.py`, or another related module.

3. **Review Recent Changes:**
   - If the tests were previously passing, consider any recent changes made to the related modules that might have introduced the error.

4. **Check for Dependency Issues:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with each other, especially if there have been updates to packages like `torch`, `pytorch_lightning`, or others used in the project.

5. **Isolate the Problem:**
   - Temporarily simplify or isolate parts of the `ResultsCollector` to identify which specific method or component is causing the failure.

By systematically reviewing these files and following the diagnostic steps, you should be able to identify and fix the error in your test suite.

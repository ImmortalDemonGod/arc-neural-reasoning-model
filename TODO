test effeciny gains: torch compile, lower precision

1. **Address Warnings**
   - Fix PyTorch Lightning logging warnings in trainer tests

2. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Focus on `src/evaluate.py` (currently 0% coverage)
   - Enhance coverage for `src/training/train.py` (currently 69% coverage)

3. **Verify GPT-2 Architecture**
   - Ensure GPT2ARC model matches GPT-2 (124M) specifications
   - Add test to verify parameter count

4. **ARC-Specific Adaptations**
   - Review ARC dataset format and adapt model input/output accordingly
   - Implement necessary preprocessing for ARC tasks

5. **Complete Training Pipeline**
   - Finish implementation of `train.py`
   - Add ARC-specific evaluation metrics

6. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all classes and functions
   - Create comprehensive README.md

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement mixed-precision training
   - Consider adding gradient accumulation

8. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Implement proper error handling throughout
   - Use Python's logging module instead of print statements

9. **Code Quality**
   - Run linter (flake8) and formatter (black)
   - Add linting and formatting checks to CI pipeline

10. **CI Enhancements**
    - Add documentation building step
    - Implement ARC dataset evaluation in CI

11. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
    - Create script for hyperparameter optimization

## Key Files and Their Purposes

1. `src/config.py`:
   - Defines `ModelConfig`, `TrainingConfig`, and `Config` classes
   - Used for managing hyperparameters and model configuration

2. `src/data/arc_dataset.py`:
   - Implements `ArcDataset` class for handling ARC data
   - Needs review to ensure compatibility with ARC challenge requirements

3. `src/models/gpt2.py`:
   - Contains `GPT2ARC` model implementation
   - Includes `Attention`, `FeedForward`, and `TransformerBlock` classes

4. `src/training/trainer.py`:
   - Implements `ARCTrainer` class using PyTorch Lightning
   - Handles training loop, optimization, and logging

5. `src/training/train.py`:
   - Main script for initiating model training
   - Needs completion and integration with ARC-specific requirements

6. `src/evaluate.py`:
   - Evaluation script (currently empty)
   - Needs implementation for ARC challenge metrics

## Environment and Dependencies

- Python versions: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Key dependencies:
  - PyTorch
  - PyTorch Lightning
  - pytest (for testing)
  - tox (for test environment management)

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
pytest -v
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml
```

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and includes:
- Testing on multiple OS and Python versions
- Running the test suite
- Generating and uploading coverage reports

## Immediate Focus Areas

1. Address PyTorch Lightning logging warnings in tests
2. Implement and improve test coverage for `evaluate.py` and `train.py`
3. Verify and document GPT-2 (124M) architecture details in our implementation
4. Begin adapting the model and dataset handling for ARC-specific requirements
